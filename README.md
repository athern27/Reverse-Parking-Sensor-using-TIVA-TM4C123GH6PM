# Reverse-Parking-Sensor-using-TIVA-TM4C123GH6PM

This project aims to develop a reverse parking monitor using Tiva C TM4C123GH6PM board and an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) using Embedded C. The system uses ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance between the vehicle and an obstacle, and based on the measured distance, it activates a visual and audio alert to warn the driver. The C code presented in this project initializes the required GPIO pins and includes functions for measuring distance, UART communication and setting up PWM for buzzer. The system can detect obstacles within a range of 3cm to 300cm and provides feedback through status LEDs and buzzer. Additionally, a UART module enables data transmission to a computer for monitoring and analysis. The reverse parking assistance system aims to enhance driving safety and convenience by providing visual and audible cues to the driver during reverse parking. 
Anyone interested about the register level programming and use of APIs with Tiva C using IAR workbench can refer this project.
